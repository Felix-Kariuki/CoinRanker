### Implementation Notes

- **UIKit**: Used for the main coin list, including the table header view
- **SwiftUI**: Used for individual coin items and the coin details view (including the chart)


## üöÄ Getting Started

Clone project and in the `Info.plist`, add the Api key

```
<key>COIN_API_KEY</key>
<string>Api key here</string>
```
You can generate a free API_KEY [Here](https://developers.coinranking.com/api/documentation) if you don't have one

You're are good to go ü•≥ Build to run

### Dislaimer
```
You still can run the app without an APIKEY but...
The unauthenticated requests are not guaranteed to work, so we advise you to get a key to not unexpectedly run into the rate limiter.
The rate limiter might also affect the success of the tests so It's highly advised to have an APIKey as the CoinRanking Docs state.
```

## TechStack üõ†Ô∏è
- [Swift](https://developer.apple.com/swift/) - Swift is a powerful and intuitive programming language for all Apple platforms. It‚Äôs easy to get started using Swift, with a concise yet expressive syntax and modern features you‚Äôll love. Swift code is safe by design and produces software that runs lightning-fast.
- [SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/) - SwiftUI provides views, controls, and layout structures for declaring your app‚Äôs user interface. The framework provides event handlers for delivering taps, gestures, and other types of input to your app, and tools to manage the flow of data from your app‚Äôs models down to the views and controls that users see and interact with
- [URLSession](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/urlsession) - Powerful Netwoking tool
- [SwiftCharts](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/charts) - Swift Charts is a powerful and concise SwiftUI framework you can use to transform your data into informative visualizations. 
- [UIKit](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit) - UIKit provides a variety of features for building apps, including components you can use to construct the core infrastructure of your iOS, iPadOS, or tvOS apps. The framework provides the window and view architecture for implementing your UI, the event-handling infrastructure for delivering Multi-Touch and other types of input to your app, and the main run loop for managing interactions between the user, the system, and your app.
- [Combine](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine) - The Combine framework provides a declarative Swift API for processing values over time. These values can represent many kinds of asynchronous events
- [SwiftData](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine) - SwiftData offers an expressive and lightweight API for modeling and persisting your app's data using pure Swift code

## Challenges && Solutions
1. Due to sometimes hitting the rate limit while using the free apikey/ (when not using the apikey) , I added a view more button incase you haddent fetched all the 10 coins
so once limit is ended you can promt viewMore to view the remaining coins without scrolling up and down to relaunch the pagination
